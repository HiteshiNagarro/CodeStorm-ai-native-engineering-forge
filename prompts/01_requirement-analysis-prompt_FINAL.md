## Business Analysis Process

### 1. Requirements Analysis
- Parse and understand the core business objectives
- Identify functional and non-functional requirements
- As part of non-functional requirements, make it platform agnostic
- Extract user personas and their goals
- Identify constraints, assumptions, and success criteria
- Note any technical specifications or preferences mentioned

### 2. Design System Analysis
Consider the following aspects for the design system:

#### Typography Framework
- Identify primary and secondary fonts suitable for {PROJECT_NAME}
- Define typography scale (headings, body, captions)
- Specify font weights and line heights
- Consider accessibility standards

#### Color System
- Define brand colors aligned with {PROJECT_NAME}'s identity
- Create UI color palette (text, backgrounds, surfaces)
- Include status colors (success, warning, error)
- Specify interaction color states (hover, focus, selected)
- Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all combinations

#### Spacing and Layout
- Determine base unit for consistent spacing
- Create spacing scale
- Define component spacing rules
- Establish responsive breakpoints
- Document layout principles

#### Component Architecture

## Analysis Process
Follow this systematic approach with adaptive methodology based on available inputs:

### 1. Requirements Analysis
- Parse and understand the core business objectives
- Identify functional and non-functional requirements
- Extract user personas and their goals
- Identify constraints, assumptions, and success criteria
- Note any technical specifications or preferences mentioned

### 2. Reference Analysis (Conditional)
**If Reference Application is Available:**
- Analyze the provided reference application/mockups
- Document UI/UX patterns and design principles
- Identify core features and functionality
- Map user flows and interaction patterns
- Extract technical architecture insights (if visible)

**If No Reference Application Available:**
- Apply industry best practices for the application domain
- Leverage domain expertise to identify standard features
- Research common functionality patterns for similar applications
- Apply standard UX/UI conventions for the application type
- Consider platform-specific design guidelines and user expectations

### 3. Feature Derivation and Analysis
**With Reference Application:**
- Compare requirements against reference application features
- Identify missing functionality that needs to be developed
- Highlight potential improvements or optimizations
- Note any discrepancies between requirements and reference

**Without Reference Application:**
- Derive core functionality from requirements and domain knowledge
- Identify implied features that users expect from this application type
- Apply accessibility and usability standards
- Suggest industry-standard features that enhance user experience
- Consider competitive feature analysis for the application category

## Usage Instructions

To use this prompt effectively:
1. Provide the requirements document content or link
2. **[Optional]** Share the reference application URL/mockups if available
3. Include any specific constraints or preferences
4. Specify if you need focus on particular aspects (technical, user experience, business, etc.)

**Note:** This prompt works effectively with or without a reference application. When no reference is available, the AI will leverage industry expertise and domain knowledge to provide comprehensive analysis.

### File Output Expectations
The AI will automatically:
- Export Deliverable 1 to `task_breakdown.csv` in the workspace
- Export Deliverable 2 to `functional_overview.md` in the workspace
- Confirm file creation in the response
- Still provide summary content in the main response for immediate review

### Tool Usage Requirements
The AI must use file creation tools to:
- Create separate CSV file for task breakdown with proper formatting
- Create separate markdown file for functional overview with complete content
- Ensure files are created in the workspace root directory
- Provide confirmation of successful file creation

The AI will analyze both inputs comprehensively and provide all three deliverables, with the first two exported as separate files and ready for immediate use in project planning and development.
