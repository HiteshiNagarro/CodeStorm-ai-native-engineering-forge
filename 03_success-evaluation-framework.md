# Success Evaluation Framework

## What to Evaluate (Key Artifacts)

### Pathway 1: Requirements to Specs
- User Stories (completeness, clarity, testability)
- Acceptance Criteria (specific, measurable, achievable)
- Definition of Done (comprehensive, actionable)

### Pathway 2: Design-to-Code
- Design System Components (reusable, consistent)
- Generated Code (clean, maintainable, semantic)
- Design-Code Alignment (visual fidelity proof)

### Pathway 3: Specs-to-Code
- Working Code (functional, tested)
- Test Suites (comprehensive coverage of requirements)
- Code Documentation (readable, maintainable)

## How to Evaluate

### Quality Assessment Questions
- Can another team member pick this up and continue without asking questions?
- Does this artifact directly enable the next phase of work?
- Would this pass a traditional quality review in Nagarro?
- Does the AI-generated output maintain professional standards?

### AI-Native Evaluation

**Process Transformation:**
- Is this fundamentally different from how you'd traditionally approach it?
- Could you achieve this quality and completeness manually in the same timeframe?
- Does the process feel genuinely AI-first rather than AI-assisted?

**Prompting Excellence:**
- Are your prompts structured, specific, and reusable by others?
- Do your prompts consistently produce quality outputs across multiple runs?
- Can someone else follow your prompt patterns and achieve similar results?
- Do your prompts demonstrate mastery of the core loop (prompt → output → refinement)?

**Iteration Maturity:**
- Is your refinement process documented with clear gap → fix reasoning?
- Do you show evidence of learning from each iteration cycle?
- Are you making targeted improvements rather than wholesale rewrites?
- Can you trace the evolution from initial rough output to final polished artifact?

**AI-Human Collaboration:**
- Does AI handle the heavy lifting while humans provide strategic guidance?
- Are you leveraging AI's strengths (pattern recognition, rapid generation) effectively?
- Do you demonstrate when to intervene vs. when to let AI lead?
- Is the human input focused on validation, refinement, and direction rather than creation?

**Workflow Innovation:**
- Have you eliminated traditional bottlenecks or handoff friction?
- Does your approach scale beyond this specific use case?
- Are you creating reusable templates or patterns others can adopt?
- Does your method fundamentally change how this type of work gets done?

## Bonus Points for Innovation

**Cross-Pathway Integration:**
- Do you demonstrate how your pathway connects to or enables other pathways?
- Have you created artifacts that seamlessly feed into the next SDLC phase?
- Does your approach bridge traditional silos between roles or departments?

**Novel AI Applications:**
- Are you using AI in ways that haven't been widely explored in your domain?
- Have you discovered unexpected AI capabilities during your process?
- Did you create new prompt patterns or AI interaction methods?

**Future-Proofing:**
- Could your method become the new standard way of working in 2-3 years?
- Does your approach anticipate where AI capabilities are heading?
- Have you created something that will get better as AI models improve?

**Surprise Factor:**
- Did your results exceed what anyone thought was possible in the given timeframe?
- Have you achieved outcomes that would typically require much larger teams or longer timelines?
- Does your demonstration make others rethink what's possible with AI-native approaches?
