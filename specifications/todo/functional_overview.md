# Todo App Functional Overview

## Application Overview

### Project Summary
A lightweight, frictionless todo application focused on quick task capture and management without the overhead of user authentication or complex features. The application emphasizes speed, simplicity, and immediate usefulness for users needing to track tasks during their browsing session.

### Core Value Proposition
- Instant task capture with zero setup
- Minimal cognitive load for users
- Focus on speed and simplicity
- No authentication barriers
- Session-based task management

### Target Audience
Primary users are individuals who need quick, temporary task tracking without committing to a full task management system. They prioritize speed over feature complexity and prefer minimal interface friction.

#### User Personas
**Quick Note Taker**
- Needs: Instant task capture, clear status tracking
- Behaviors: Adds tasks sporadically, manages completion status
- Goals: Track temporary todos without setup overhead
- Pain Points: Complex apps, login requirements, feature overload

## Functional Requirements

### Core Features

#### Task Management
- **Task Creation** (BR01)
  - Single-click input focus
  - Enter key submission
  - Empty task prevention
  - Automatic chronological ordering

#### Status Handling
- **Task States** (BR02)
  - Binary status: Open or Completed
  - Individual toggle via checkbox
  - Bulk status updates
  - Status reversion capability

#### View Management
- **Filtering** (BR03)
  - All tasks view
  - Active tasks view
  - Completed tasks view
  - Clear completed functionality

### User Workflows

#### Task Creation Flow
1. User accesses application
2. Clicks input field or starts typing
3. Enters task text
4. Presses Enter to save
5. Task appears at top of list

#### Task Completion Flow
1. User locates task
2. Clicks checkbox or uses bulk action
3. Visual feedback shows completion
4. Task remains in list until cleared

#### Task Organization Flow
1. User selects desired view filter
2. System displays matching tasks
3. Optional: Clear completed tasks
4. List updates instantly

### Data Management
- In-memory storage
- Session-based persistence
- No backend requirements
- Real-time state updates

## Technical Considerations

### Recommended Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework:** React
- **State Management:** Local state or lightweight store
- **Styling:** CSS-in-JS or CSS Modules
- **Build Tool:** Create React App or Vite

### Architecture Patterns
- Component-based architecture
- Unidirectional data flow
- Event-driven interactions
- Presentational/Container pattern

### Security Requirements
- No authentication needed
- No sensitive data storage
- Standard XSS prevention
- Basic input sanitization

### Performance Expectations
- Initial load < 2 seconds
- Interaction response < 100ms
- Smooth animations (60fps)
- Minimal memory footprint

### Scalability Considerations
- Session-based scaling only
- No database requirements
- Minimal server resources
- Client-side processing

## Success Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
1. Time to First Task
   - Target: < 5 seconds from page load
2. Task Completion Rate
   - Target: > 90% successful status updates
3. Filter Response Time
   - Target: < 100ms view changes
4. User Interaction Success
   - Target: > 95% successful actions

### User Acceptance Criteria
- **AC01:** Users can add tasks in < 2 seconds
- **AC02:** All status changes reflect instantly
- **AC03:** Filter views update without perceived lag
- **AC04:** Bulk actions complete in < 1 second
- **AC05:** Clear completed tasks works reliably

### Business Success Metrics
1. Session Duration
2. Tasks Created per Session
3. Feature Usage Distribution
4. Error Rate
5. Performance Metrics

### Business Rules
- **BR01:** Tasks must have non-empty content
- **BR02:** Task status changes are reversible
- **BR03:** Filter views must be mutually exclusive
- **BR04:** Task order preserves chronological addition
- **BR05:** Completed tasks clear action is permanent
