### User Workflows and Processes

#### Primary Workflow: Quick Task Capture
1. User opens application (no login required)
2. User sees prominent text input field
3. User types task description
4. User presses Enter or clicks Add
5. Task appears in list immediately
6. Input field clears for next task

#### Secondary Workflow: Task Completion
1. User views task list
2. User clicks checkbox next to completed task
3. Task visually changes to completed state (strikethrough)
4. Task remains in list but marked as done
5. User can toggle status back if needed

#### Tertiary Workflow: List Management
1. User applies filter to view specific task types
2. User reviews completed items for satisfaction
3. User performs bulk operations when needed
4. User clears completed tasks periodically

### Integration Requirements
**Session Storage Integration:**
- Browser session storage for task persistence
- No server-side data storage required
- No external API integrations needed
- No authentication service integration

### Data Management Needs
**Data Structure:**
- Task ID (auto-generated)
- Task description (user input)
- Status (boolean: open/completed)
- Creation timestamp
- Session-based storage only

**Data Lifecycle:**
- Created: When user adds new task
- Updated: When status changes
- Deleted: When user clears completed tasks
- Expired: When browser session ends

## Technical Considerations

### Recommended Technology Stack

#### Frontend Framework
**React (Primary Recommendation):**
- Aligns with reference application (TodoMVC React)
- Excellent state management for task operations
- Strong community support and documentation
- Optimal performance for list rendering
- Built-in accessibility features

**Alternative Options:**
- Vue.js for simpler learning curve
- Vanilla JavaScript for minimal footprint
- Svelte for performance optimization

#### State Management
**React Hooks (useState/useEffect):**
- Sufficient for application complexity
- No external state management library needed
- Built-in React capabilities handle all requirements

#### Styling Approach
**CSS Modules or Styled Components:**
- Component-scoped styling
- Maintainable and scalable
- Responsive design support

#### Storage Solution
**Browser Session Storage:**
- Perfect for temporary data persistence
- No backend infrastructure required
- Automatic cleanup on session end
- Privacy-friendly (no data transmission)

### Architecture Patterns

#### Component Architecture
```
App (Root)
├── TaskInput (Task creation)
├── TaskList (Task display and management)
│   ├── TaskItem (Individual task rendering)
│   └── TaskFilter (Filter controls)
└── TaskStats (Counter and bulk operations)
```

#### State Management Pattern
- Single source of truth for tasks array
- Local state for UI interactions (filter, selections)
- Event-driven updates for task modifications
- Session storage synchronization

### Security Requirements
**Minimal Security Needs:**
- No user authentication required
- No personal data collection
- No server communication
- Client-side only application
- Standard browser security model sufficient

### Performance Expectations

#### Load Time Targets

- Task addition response: < 100ms
- Filter application: < 50ms
- Bulk operations: < 200ms

#### Scalability Considerations
- Support for up to 1000 tasks per session
- Efficient list rendering (virtualization if needed)
- Optimized DOM updates for status changes
- Memory usage monitoring for long sessions

### Scalability Considerations
**Current Scope:**
- Single-user, session-based application
- No concurrent user support needed
- No data synchronization requirements

**Future Considerations:**
