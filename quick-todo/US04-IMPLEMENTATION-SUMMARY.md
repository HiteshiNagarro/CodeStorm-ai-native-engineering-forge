- **Test Coverage**: 27/27 component tests pass, validating chronological ordering

### ✅ AC02: Each task shows text and status  
- **Implemented**: Task text and completion status (checkbox) displayed for each item
- **Evidence**: TodoItem component renders task text, checkbox, and visual status indicators
- **Test Coverage**: Visual display and status interaction fully tested

### ✅ AC03: List updates dynamically
- **Implemented**: Real-time updates via TodoContext state management
- **Evidence**: Component re-renders automatically when todos added/updated through context
- **Test Coverage**: Dynamic update behavior validated through integration tests

### ✅ AC04: Empty state handled gracefully
- **Implemented**: Comprehensive empty state with helpful messaging and icons
- **Evidence**: TodoList shows "No todos yet" message with guidance when empty
- **Test Coverage**: Empty state rendering and transitions fully validated

## Technical Implementation Details

### Core Components
- **TodoList**: Main display component with sorting, filtering, and empty state handling
