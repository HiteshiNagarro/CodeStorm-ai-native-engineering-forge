# AI-Native Hackathon Documentation

Welcome to the AI-Native Engineering Forge hackathon! This README provides a comprehensive guide to all documentation for our innovative challenge focused on pioneering AI-first ways of working in software development.

This hackathon is designed to explore what it means to build software end-to-end with AI as your primary collaborator, not just your assistant. We're challenging teams to fundamentally rewire how they think about building software â€” starting with AI capabilities and human creativity as equal partners from day one.

## Documentation Overview

Please review the following documents in chronological order to fully understand the hackathon structure, requirements, and expectations:

### 01. [AI-Native Hackathon Rules](ai-native-hackathon-rules.md)
