# AI-Native Engineering Forge Guidelines

Welcome to the AI-Native Engineering Forge hackathon! This README provides a comprehensive guide to all documentation for our innovative challenge focused on pioneering AI-first ways of working in software development.

This hackathon is designed to explore what it means to build software end-to-end with AI as your primary collaborator, not just your assistant. We're challenging teams to fundamentally rewire how they think about building software â€” starting with AI capabilities and human creativity as equal partners from day one.

## Getting Started

- Read documentation in order as described in *Documentation Overview*
- Clone the repository
- Create a new branch with your team name
- Implement the task, [as described here](05_todo-app-requirements.md)
- Submit a pull request against the main branch
- Notes
  - You can choose any tech stack of your choice
  - For every task you must/should have a "final" dedicted prompt
  - You must maintain all your "final" prompts inside a `prompts` folder
