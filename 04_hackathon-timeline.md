# AI-Native Hackathon Timeline

## Important: Your Commitment Matters

This is a hands-on, AI-native challenge that requires dedicated time and thoughtful engagement. Unlike traditional hackathons, this exercise demands deep thinking about AI-first methodologies and genuine innovation in your approach to software engineering. Please allocate sufficient time to fully explore the possibilities within your chosen pathway.

This activity is part of a larger organization-wide initiative to pioneer the future of AI-native development. Exceptional work and breakthrough innovations may provide opportunities for participants to present their findings to senior leadership and contribute to shaping our organizational AI strategy. Your contributions here could influence how we approach AI-first development across the entire company.

## Participation Requirements

**Mandatory Participation:** Active participation throughout the week and successful submission of both tasks is required to proceed to the Friday hackathon session. Teams that do not submit their work will not be eligible to present or compete for prizes.

**Task Progression:** Submission of Task 1 is mandatory to receive Task 2. Teams that fail to submit Task 1 by the Thursday deadline will not be provided with Task 2 and cannot proceed to the Friday hackathon session.

**Submission Deadlines:** All task submissions must be completed by the specified deadlines. Late submissions will not be accepted and may result in disqualification from the final session.

**Team Commitment:** All team members are expected to contribute meaningfully to their chosen pathway and be present for the Friday presentations.
